            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Ou deſire my opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this late great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, the Kings going into the Army: My judgement is ſhortly and clearly thus; That His Majeſty went thither neither againſt His own will, nor the deſire of the Army. I believe His Majeſty had no reaſon to be very fond of the place
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99446:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 33 -->where he was before, or of the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects he received there, being (without doubt) at the top of his preferment, and in all likelihood not to have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſo well ſo long, had not ſome ſtronger bridle, then that of allegiance to him, or religion to God, made them forbeare any further attempt. For that which you pleaſed, or rather your fears, to ſuggeſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That His Majeſty is leapt out of the frying-pan into the fire, left ill company, to adhere to worſe; becauſe you are pleaſed to ſay (and you do but ſay it) that this Army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of Independents, who are worſe principled for Magiſtracy, then thoſe of the other party. I anſwer; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it cannot be denied, that out of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their Books we may gather ſuch Concluſions, which for part I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99446:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 33 -->allow of. But that the Feares and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies of both Houſes may not forſake their old Maſters, in ſuch a buſie time as this, and wholly take up and poſſeſſe your breſt, I pray Sir reaſonably weigh all circumſtances, and you ſhall finde, that His Majeſty hath fallen into much better company, then either his Countrey-men were to him, or commended him to, (not to ſay, ſold and betrayed him.)</p>
            <p>Of theſe men (call them Independents, or what you will) I have had a great deale of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. I finde them in their way very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout, very juſt in their dealing; and of all the Armies imployed by the Parliament in this unnaturall warre, I will be bold to ſay, none behaved themſelves more civilly, more chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianly againſt the adverſe party then they: and confidering their different judgments and opinions, none were more in charity, and more at unity among themſelves. In all my diſcourſe I had with them (and I talkt with many of them) I finde a great deale of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and lowlineſſe amongſt them: But as they deſire to exerciſe no ſevere juriſdiction over other mens conſciences, ſo they ſeeme to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99446:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 34 -->deſire in like manner that none may over theirs. I doe not truly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that they have a minde to give Law to any other, but onely to procure their owne liberty and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et: this liberty they cannot have under the Presbytery, who have both in Pulpit and Preſſe declared ſo bitterly (I had almoſt ſaid ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianly) againſt them. How then, or by whom can they hope to enjoy this priveledge more freely, more fully, then by receiving it from Him, who hath the ſole power in theſe Dominions, under <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> to grant it? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make no doubt, but that there will bee a very right underſtanding begotten betweene the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Army:</hi> And that as they are rayſed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99446:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 35 -->by GOD at this time to re-inveſt him with his juſt, lawfull Rights and Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, to the eternall ſhame of his <hi>owne Nation,</hi> (the firſt Nation that ever I read of who <hi>ſold their King</hi>) ſo I doubt not but His Majeſty will ſo well reſent this ſeaſonable kindneſſe of theirs, that as they preſerve his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Honour,</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> ſo he will be as tender of theirs. And truly, I think him fit to be brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne puniſhment, as an evill Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour, that ſhall even go about to ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enate the Kings heart from them, or make him to forget this <hi>handſome loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of theirs, that hath ſo gallantly ſhewed it ſelfe in the middeſt of ſo much cruelty, neglect, and contempt, and when his Majeſties other friends had ſo little power or opportunity to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99446:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 36 -->doe him good. And this I deliver the more clearely, becauſe you know I am no party at all in this buſineſſe; but (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your deſire) I have given my ſenſe: And what you have more to ſay, I pray communicate as freely to</p>
